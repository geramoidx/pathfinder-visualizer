## Overview of Pathfinding Algorithms

This project implements the following pathfinding and search algorithms.

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms. Guarantees the shortest path possible.

**A Search*** (weighted): arguably the best pathfinding algorithm. Uses heuristics to guarantee the best shortest possible path much faster than the Dijkstra's algorithm.
